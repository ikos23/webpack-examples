## Loaders

```
Out of the box, webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON files.
Loaders allow webpack to processother types of files and convert
them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application
and added to the dependency graph.
```

This simple project demonstrates usage of most common
Webpack Loaders (css, fonts, images, xml, csv...).
