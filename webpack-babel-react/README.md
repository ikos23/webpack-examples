# webpack-babel-react

This is an example of React App built from Scratch. ðŸ’¥
Tools used: Webpack, Babel and ReactJS.

1. Add [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) : `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`
2. Add [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) : `npm i react react-dom`
3. Add [Babel](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation) : `npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core`
4. Add React preset : `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react`

To build production version:

```
npm run build
```

Or, you can start dev server to quickly develop an application:

```
npm run start:dev
```

This is not a real app; there are many things that
can be improved, but it is a good example of
how easy we can build React App from scratch.
